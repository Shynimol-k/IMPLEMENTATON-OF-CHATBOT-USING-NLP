# **Implementation of Chatbot Using NLP**
## **Overview**
This project implements a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand user intents and provide appropriate responses based on predefined patterns and responses. It utilizes the nltk library for natural language processing, scikit-learn for machine learning, and streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.

## **Features**
- **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes NLP techniques to understand and process user input.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implements machine learning algorithms for intent recognition, response generation, and continuous learning.
- **Real-time Interaction:** Offers a responsive, user-friendly interface built using Streamlit.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python:** Main programming language used for development.
- **Streamlit:** For building the web-based user interface.
- **NLTK :** For text preprocessing, including tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.
- **Scikit-learn :** Machine learning libraries for implementing various NLP models.
- **JSON:** For defining intents and responses.

## **System Requirements**
### **Hardware Requirements**
- **Processor:** Intel Core i5 (minimum), Intel Core i7 or better recommended.
- **RAM:** 8 GB minimum, 16 GB or higher recommended.
- **Storage:** At least 256 GB SSD, 512 GB SSD or more preferred.
  
### **Software Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux.
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8 or newer.
- **Libraries:** Streamlit, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

## **Installation**
To run the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone : https://github.com/Shynimol-k/IMPLEMENTATON-OF-CHATBOT-USING-NLP
   
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4.  Download NLTK Data
   ```bash
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## **Features**
- Understands various user intents such as greetings, farewells, gratitude, and more.
- Provides relevant responses based on user input.
- Maintains a conversation history that can be viewed by the user.
- Built using Python and leverages popular libraries for NLP and machine learning.

## **Usage**
- The chatbot can respond to different queries based on pre-defined intents (e.g., greetings, support, location, poetry,  etc...).
- Enter your query in the provided text box, and the chatbot will process the input and provide a response.

## **Future Work**
- Extend the chatbot to handle more complex use cases, such as multi-turn conversations.
- Implement reinforcement learning to improve responses over time.
- Integrate external APIs for additional functionality.

## **How to run**
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:

streamlit run app.py
Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

## **Conversation History**
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (chat_log.csv). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.

## **Project Experience and Acquired Expertise**
Working on the **Implementation of Chatbot Using NLP** project was a rewarding experience that allowed me to dive into natural language processing, machine learning, and software development. I had the chance to work with tools like Streamlit for creating interactive interfaces and Python libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn for tasks such as text preprocessing and intent classification.  

This project helped me better understand key NLP concepts like tokenization, lemmatization, and entity recognition while also learning how to optimize chatbot responses for accuracy. It was a great opportunity to enhance my problem-solving skills and build a user-friendly, AI-powered conversational system.  

Thank you to everyone who supported me throughout this journeyâ€”your guidance and encouragement were invaluable in making this project a successðŸ™‚.
